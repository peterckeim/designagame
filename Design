Design Reflections--

I really really really want to be done with this.

regarding canceling games:
it's my belief that if you need to cancel your game, you need
to take a loss, otherwise players will simply delete / cancel
games when performing poorly, so it does not affect their ranking.
That's letting the ragequitters win, and ragequitters never deserve
to win.

General thoughts:
-It was hard to debug sometimes because printing to the appengine log is a little more than just 'print'
-Sublime 3 is pretty amazing.
-PEP 8 sometimes doesn't work, and I don't agree with the standard being indentation by space instead of tab.
