Design Reflections--

Hangman was the easiest game I could think of to spin off the original guessing game. The trick was thinking how to show the blank spaces
which the user would guess, and how it would be slowly revealed. It was not until I had 'guessed_letters' and 'correct_letters' that
things began to fall into place. I was originally going to have a 'missed_letters' and 'correct_letters', but I needed a combined
list to use in revealing the blank spaces, as well as to show the player everything they guessed, not just the missed letters.

For scorekeeping and performance, there are still other ways I could improve, but for the sake of clarity, and for the sake of players
also being able to understand why they received the score they did, I left it with the traditional 6 strikes. 

History was a bit of a challenge, because I wasn't sure how on earth to store and retrieve a list of dictionaries from appengine,
and I ended up using JSON. It looks ugly when retrieved, but it works. I wish I knew how to make it prettier.

regarding canceling games:
it's my belief that if you need to cancel your game, you need
to take a loss, otherwise players will simply delete / cancel
games when performing poorly, so it does not affect their ranking.
That's letting the ragequitters win, and ragequitters never deserve
to win.

General thoughts:
-It was hard to debug sometimes because printing to the appengine log is a little more than just 'print'
-Sublime 3 is pretty amazing.
